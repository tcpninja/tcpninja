# 👋 Hola, I’m Karl

**Security Nomade | Cloud & AI Security Architect | Startup Ally**  
Building practical, developer-aligned security for fast-moving teams.  

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- 🔒 **Secure-by-Default Systems** — guardrails in Git, not gatekeepers in suits.  
- 🤖 **AI + Agentic Security** — exploring how LLMs reshape both attacks and defenses.  
- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Security** — Kubernetes, Zero Trust, and identity-first architectures.  
- 🎤 **Global Security Culture** — Study 

---

## 🛠️ Current Projects
- [**Cloud Native CISO**](https://cloudnativeciso.com) — A platform helping startups bake in practical cloud & AI-native security.  
- [**Secure-by-Default Starter v1.0.0**](https://github.com/cloudnativeciso/secure-by-default-starter) — GitHub template repo for startups to ship security with their first commit.  
- **AI Security Labs** — hands-on experiments combining GitOps, LLMOps, and modern security tooling.

## 🌍 Backstory
I’ve led security in boardrooms, data centers, and startups just trying to get their first enterprise customer.  

At Duo Security (Cisco), I helped launch the APJC region — guiding execs and engineers through Zero Trust adoption before it had a playbook.  

Then I traded suits for a backpack — three years, 12 countries, and a crash course in how different cultures build trust. That perspective now shapes how I architect security for distributed teams and AI-native startups shipping at breakneck speed.  

Today I run **Cloud Native CISO** — helping small teams bake security into how they build, from the very first commit.
