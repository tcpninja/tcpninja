# 👋 Hola, I’m Karl

**Principal Security Architect | AI & Cloud-Native Security Advocate | Startup Evangelist**  
Building practical, developer-aligned security for fast-moving teams.

## 🚀 What I Do
- 🔒 **Secure-by-Default Systems** — designing security that scales without slowing startups down.  
- 🤖 **AI + Agentic Security** — exploring how LLMs and automation reshape security programs.  
- ☁️ **Cloud-Native Security** — Kubernetes, Zero Trust, and identity-first architectures.  
- 🎤 **Evangelism** — writing, speaking, and open-source contributions to democratize security.

## 🛠️ Current Projects
- [**Cloud Native CISO**](https://cloudnativeciso.com) — A platform helping startups bake in practical cloud & AI-native security.  
- [**Secure-by-Default Starter v1.0.0**](https://github.com/cloudnativeciso/secure-by-default-starter) — GitHub template repo for startups to ship security with their first commit.  
- **AI Security Labs** — hands-on experiments combining GitOps, LLMOps, and modern security tooling.

## ✍️ Writing & Speaking
- 📝 [**Blog**](https://cloudnativeciso.com/blog) — practical playbooks & insights for builders.  
- 🎙️ Guest on podcasts and panels around presales and cybersecurity.  
- 📚 Upcoming: frameworks for **Minimum Viable Security (MVS)** and **Mergeable Trust**.

## 🌍 Backstory
Over a decade leading high-impact security and presales engagements across startups, Fortune 500s, and SaaS providers:  
- Expanded a world-leading cybersecurity company into APAC.  
- Closed record-breaking enterprise deals by turning complexity into trust.  
- Led Zero Trust adoption before it was trendy.  

Then I took a deliberate break — four years, 25 countries, and a recalibration.  
Now I bring that same curiosity and clarity to helping startups **move fast *and* stay safe**.
